sprite 1: DINO

sprite 1: gnarls
Player: What a weird looking thing.
Wait, the is something written on the ground.
Ground: "Do you know where I am?"
Player: Oh? It seems that he understands our language and he
comunicates by writing on the ground with its' claws.
sprite 1: clears ground and writes something else.
Ground: "Well, I guess I just have to adapt first. My homeland looks more like a desert though."
Player: Wait, his claw looks injured, maybe I can get him something to cover up the wound.

//You can obtain bandage from the man with bandages//
Player:bandages the hurt claw*

sprite 1: humms happily, waving its' tail and writes on the ground again:
"Thank you, sir. I do not have mutch to offer, but take this."

Player: its' behavour actually reminds me of a dog.

//Player obtains "stick"//

sprite 2: DOCTOR

Monk: "Are you lost, my child?"

Player: Oh? He is looking very similar to me, could it be that we are we the same species?

Monk: "This is a weird place, isn't it? But 
even if it's unfamilar, for me, it doesn't matter where I am, for my faith will always be my guide."

Player: I do not know if this is noble or strange... was I religious too? Ugh I don't
remember, my head hurts."

Monk: Are you okay my child? You look pained. Take this, it might prove itself
useful for you, it must be fate, that we crossed paths.

The monk spread his hand out in your direction and in it, a torch grew out.

//Player obtains torch//
Player: Maybe I can find a way to light it.

Sprite 3: DOG

Sprite 3 jumps around you.

Player: Oh this thing is energetic, first it scared me with its'
scary looking teeth, but weirdly, it seems kind of... playful?

If player has stick:

Player: throws stick

Sprite 3 runs after the stick and brings it back, laying it in front of the Player.

Player: Again? I don't know if I have time for this, but it's also a little fun. throws stick again

Sprite 3 runs after the stick and brings it back proudly.
Player: I mean, it seems intelligent enough to know what it should do. Wait, maybe this thing thinks the same thing about me.

...

Ok one last throw. throws stick

Player: Oops, it went a little too far.

Sprite 3 comes back with a dead insect in it's mouth.

Player: Ew, what is that.

//Player obtains dead insect//
I think we can make Sprite4 EYE_BALL stay the way it is, 
but instead of the red crystal the Player obtains a melody. 
And since he has amnesia, he forgot that this existed, he also 
feels calmed by it (important for sprite 6 NURSE)

Sprite 5: NECROMANCER

Sprite 5: "Hello, mortal."

Player: startled What was that? I am sure he talked to me, but not with his mouth,
but... inside my own head?

Sprite 5: "I see, you do not feel like communicating back. Nevertheless, even I can feel quite lonely." 

"You know, it was really bad for me when I woke up in this world, I was in the bright
sunlight! I don't even know how I got there but it was painful for sure."

Player: I just can't get used to him talking to me like this, feels like I can not even
hear my own thouhts.

Sprite 5: "Whoever is at fault for this chaos, it must be a cruel being. Everyone knows that
Dawouas must be in the dark. I would have rather died than to expierence that pain from sunlight again. 

Player: He just keeps going, I do believe he really must be lonely then. Also... Dawoua,
that's what his species is called? 

Sprite 5: "I always keep myself entertained with my little pet Kathy here. Say hello, Kathy. 

Kathy: "Hello."

Player: This can't be. A female voice now? But I was sure this skeleton is... well, dead.
It looks like a human skull, which is making this more uncomfortable for me now.

Sprite 5: talking to the skull

Player: Finally, I cannot hear him anymore. It looks like he is collecting human bones.

/Conversation end if player has no torch and no bone hand/

If Player has torch and no bone hand:

Player: tries to light his torch

Sprite 5: "Hey friend, this fire is not for just anyone. In my land we only gave it to those,
we saw as worthy."

Player: There must be another way.

If player has bone hand and no torch:

Player: I think he might like this.
Sprite 5: "I cannot take this, without giving you something in return, even though I really like it."

If player has torch and bone hand:

Sprite 5: "Thank you very mutch for this gift, it was really thoughtful, I can see."
lights Players torch

//Player obtains fire torch//

We can make it less complex, if you only want the torch + bone skull option

Sprite 6: NURSE

Sprite 6: "G O. A W A Y."

Player: Oh my, I should probably do what it sais.

Sprite 6: "AAAAAAAA"

Player: I don't know why, but I kind of pity it.

/If Player has melodybox/

Player: plays melodybox

Sprite 6: "AAAAAaaaaa.... aaa....."

Player: " She seems to calm down now."

...

Sprite 6: ... closes eyes 

...
"What a beautiful melody. Where I came from, you could hear similar melodies all over. 
Every place had it's own, with a fitting rhythm, you were almost never left in silence,
like you are here. Silence is a sign for danger, where I am from. But you don't seem
dangerous at all to me.
Let me thank you.

//Player obtains kife hand//

Player: What a weird present.

Sprite 6: " Do not worry, they grow back. giggles

#######################################################################

Sprite 7: PATIENT

Sprite 7: "Hey mister... as you can see, I am pretty hurt."

Player: ...

Sprite 7: "If you can find me some medicine, I can give you a bandage as a return, I have so many
bandages but nothing to put in them for faster healing.

Player: He seems to be getting straight to the point.

Sprite 7: Come on, after all you could also get hurt easily here.

Player: Why does that sound like a threat?

Sprite 7: I did not mean mean it as a threat.
Player: Can he read my mind? If you can read my mind say watermelon.

...

Sprite 7: ... Sooo if you have medicine come back to me, please.

Player: Phew, knew it.

/If player has medicine/

Player hands medicine to Sprite 7

Sprite 7: Oh! Thank you very much.

//Player obtains bandages//

Sprite 8: PIRANHA

Sprite 8: snaps

Player: This plant seems dangerous... and hungry, I should try to stay away from it.
But I am getting hungry and those berries look delicious.

Sprite 8: keeps snapping at Player

Player: Maybe I can find a way to distract it.

/If Player has dead insect/

Player: Feeds dead insect to plant
Now is my chance!

Dang I hope they are not poisonous.

Sprite 9: SKELETON

Sprite 9: "Hello, my fleshy fella."

Player: What did he just call me.

Sprite 9: "Watch this" performes a dance with his axe. "Neat am I right?"

Player: ...

Sprite 9: "Oh I see, you are the shy type. You have a mouth for a reason though."

Player: Now that he said it, how does he even talk? He does not have a mouth or
vocal cords or even organs. He shouldn't even be alive at this point.

Sprite 9: "Well, the last thing I remember is that I was with my girlfriend,
the prettiest bones in town, haha, and suddenly I am here. What is going on, am I right?"

Player: ...

/If Player has knife hand/

Sprite 9: "Hey mate, what's that? Looks really cool! It would suit me am I right? Hahahaha!"

Sprite 9: "Do not worry, I am a proud guy with honor, of course you get something as equally cool
back here.

#######################################################################

Sprite 10:

Sprite 10: "I hate this place. Makes me look like an ugly slime."

Player: ...

Sprite 10: "No, really I'm serious, in my land I look like a pretty, puffy being,
the air pressure here is really not complimenting my looks down here."

Player: Now I wonder what his actual form might look like.

Sprite 10: "Oh well, there is nothing you can do about it, at this rate I will
probably not make it though... I wish my family was here with me in my last moments.
Who knows, maybe this is hell."

/If Player has feather/

Sprite 10: "Hey, what are you holding there?"

Player hands feather to Sprite 10

Sprite 10: "Unbelievable. This feather... it reminds me of my wife back home.
Now I can see it clearly! I just had a feeling that I had a family before,
but now I know for sure. 

My wife used to collect these. Weird right? But that's why I loved her so much.

Player: I guess he can keep it.

#######################################################################

Sprite 11: TOOTH_WALKER

Sprite 11: "Am hungry."

Player: He seems to have a rather unusual shape. I do not know what creatures like him might eat,
since I cannot remember anything like him from where I am from.

Player: ... But where am I from again? Argh... my head...

Sprite: "Want food."

/If Player has fire torch/

Sprite: "TASTY"
"DELICIOUS"
"WONDERFUL"

Sprite 13:  WITCH

Sprite 12: "How can I help you?"

Player: ...

Sprite 12: "Oh? Did you not come to my house for my serive? I can make anything, if potions or medicine, there is nothing that a witch can't do.

Sadly almost all my rations have gone bad. I think they are not in the right habitat here.

Hmm... it's really weird, I came here with my house. The other beings I talked to here
did come all alone. I also don't know for sure if that's my house,
I just think it's way too familiar to not be. 

Player: That is indeed weird. 
Sprite 12: "I kind of miss being able to craft something. Hey, I have an idea,
if you can bring me ingredients, I can make something for you, free of charge, what do you think?

/If Player has herbs/

Sprite 12: "Oh! I think I remember a herb that looks very similar to this, back where I came from.
Haha I didn't think I could start remembering anything just by looking at a plant. 

This herb here has healing abilities. 

chomp chomp chomp

Sprite 12: "Just one secret ingredient, and voila! 

Ah this was fun, now just like I promised, you can have it.
