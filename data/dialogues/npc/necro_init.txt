Hello Mortal
<p>
&player
[startled] What was that?! did he just talk
to me,  but not with his mouth
<p>
&player
I am sure I heard him inside my head
<p>
&necro
I see, you don't feel like communicating back
Nevertheless, even I can feel quite lonely
<p>
&necro
...sigh
<p>
&necro
When I woke up here, I felt unfathomable
pain, I was in the bright sunlight! I don't
even know how I got here, but it was painful
<p>
&player
I am unable to get used to him talking like
this, feels like I can't even hear my own
thoughts
<p>
&necro
Whoever is at fault for this chaos, must be
a cruel being
<p>
&necro
Everyone knows that us Dawouas must only
stay in the dark
<p>
&necro
I would have rather died than experience
that pain again
<p>
&player
He just keeps going
<p>
&player
He must really be lonely then
<p>
&necro
I always keep myself entertained with my
little pet Kathy here
<p>
&necro
Greet the child for me, will you
<p>
&
[female voice] Hi Child!
<p>
&player
[surprised] Wait is...
<p>
&player
Is she that skull?!
<p>
&player
But that's dead...
<p>
&player
This is making me very uncomfortable
<p>
&
You stop hearing him
<e>
&player
Do you Yield?
<p>
&
He doesn't respond
<e>
