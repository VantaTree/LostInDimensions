Saldy all the rations I carry in my hat have
gone bad
<p>
&witch
I bet it's this dimension that caused it
<p>
&player
This place is really weird

&witch

<p>
&witch
I always bring my house to where ever I go
But I can't open the house anymore
I swear It's mine, who else's would it be
<p>
&witch
All the people I talked to here don't seem to
have brought anything with them
<p>
