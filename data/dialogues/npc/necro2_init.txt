How are you at the end of this very long
corridor?

&necro
Haha, You see I collect souls, but no ordinary
souls, special powerfull ones.
<p>
&necro
You know like you
<p>
&player
WHAT! I don't know what you are talking
about, I don't even know who I am
<p>
&necro
You are so Naive!
<p>
&necro
That is how I am able to collect so many
souls
<p>
&necro
By burning your memories, and putting
them in my specially crafted dimension
<p>
&player
It was you all along

each of them, Not everyone I capture has a
Soul like you

<p>
&necro
We aren't too different, I knew it must be
you when I gave you the flame, It was
draining your soul all along, Muhahahah
<p>
&necro
It's about time It finishes it's purpose
<p>
&player
Wait, that's impossible I gave the burning
torch away
<p>
&necro
You think that torch was important, NO
