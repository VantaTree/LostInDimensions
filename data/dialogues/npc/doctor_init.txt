OH, He is very similar looking to me, could it
be that we are from the same place?
<p>
&doctor
This is a weird place, isn't it, But...

&doctor
Even if it is unfamilar for me, it doesn't
matter where I am, for my faith will always
be my guide
<p>
&player
I do not know if this is noble or strange...
Was I religious too? Ugh I don't remember
My head hurts
<p>
&doctor
Are you okay my child? you look pained
<p>
&doctor
Take this, it might prove itself useful to
someone like you

The man spread his hand out in your direction
and from it a torch grew out.

You obtained an "Unlit Torch"

&player
Maybe I can find a way to light it?

&doctor
It must be fate that we crossed path in this
mess of worlds

&doctor

&doctor
You must go on from here onwards
